This small utility define commands to display the type/function name the cursor in. You can also jump to the closest function/type name in scope.

Command:
    SFunc -- Show type/function name
    JFunc  -- Jump to closest type/function name in scope

shortcut:
     ,f    -- call SFunc
     \f    -- call JFunc

It doesn't relies on ctags file, but it use the syntax file in vim 7.0. It should work for C#/Java/C++, but it has best support for C#. In addition to function, it can also recognize property/event in C#.
